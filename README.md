# The Book Place

This repository contains the code for a MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node.js) web application called "The Book Place", that was developed for the course "Software Engineering for the Internet", of the Jerusalem College of technology.

The application represents an online book shop and social network. Passport.js was used for authentication, Socket.IO for the blogging and real-time chat parts of the website, and the Formidable middleware assisted in client-to-server file uploads.
